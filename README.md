I am a mechatronics engineering student at the University of Waterloo! I started learning to code on my own, by watching online tutorials. I enjoy a good challenge and solving problems through code. When I'm not scratching my head at my desk trying to implement a new feature in my code or fixing a bug, I am usually drawing or playing chess.I am passionate about learning, empowering young females in tech, and humanitarian work. Feel free to get in touch!
